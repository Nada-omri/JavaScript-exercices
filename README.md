# JavaScript Exercises Repository

This repository contains several JavaScript exercises implemented as HTML files. Each exercise demonstrates different aspects of JavaScript programming.

## Exercise 1 - Age Status
File: `exercice1.html`

This exercise involves an array of persons with their names and ages. The script maps each person to their age status (majeur or mineur). Check the file for the implementation.

## Exercise 2 - Name Splitting
